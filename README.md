Task 4 â€“ Data Preprocessing (Accident Dataset)
ðŸ“Œ Description
This task involved preprocessing the **US Accidents dataset** by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing it for analysis. Due to large dataset size, a smaller sample (`accidents_sample.csv`) was used for demonstration.

âœ… Steps Performed
- Checked and handled missing values in multiple columns.
- Filled numerical missing values with median and categorical with mode.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Displayed the cleaned dataset ready for machine learning models.
